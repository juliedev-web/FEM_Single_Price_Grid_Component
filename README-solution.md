## My process
- I first did the mobile version of the project. I thought it could be easier to make the responsive design and adapt it for the desktop version. 

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned

To choose between which version to do first. I think it is easier to build it mobile first and then to use the media query for the desktop version.
